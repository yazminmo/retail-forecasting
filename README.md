# retail-forecasting

The purpose of this code is to convert rows in a test chunk into forecasts. It does so by iterating through each chunk and each lead time within the chunk.

For each lead time, it retrieves the corresponding row of data from the chunk based on a specific offset. If the data for the lead time is not available, it creates a mock row with placeholder values. Otherwise, it stores the actual forecast row. The code ultimately returns an array of forecasts.

In real life, this code can be used in time series forecasting tasks where historical data is divided into chunks or segments, and forecasts need to be generated for each lead time within those chunks.
